As technology continues to advance and become a more prominent part of our lives, window shopping - and shopping in general - has become increasingly popular to do online. Companies need to adapt and figure out new marketing tactics since what works in store may not necessarily work online. Is it best to try and capture new customers? Is it better to try and get returning customers? With these two questions in mind, I decided to analyze browsing sessions from an online shop and test several ensemble models to see if it can correctly classify customers and their intentions based on browsing behaviors. 

I tested several ensemble methods for classifying whether browsing sessions will end in a sale as well as for classifying the two types of customers coming to the site: new and returning. With the revenue classification, I was looking for the most robust and well rounded model. For the customer classification, I looked for the model that had the smallest amount of false positives (new customers being classified as returning customers).
